This things called @sGit.
Hey it works for editing.. Inside application.

[ctrl+s] does nothing. Thankfully.
Matches brackets when typing with color.
File made with no suffixing filetype. 
Will next: 
Add filetype to view syntax highlights in edit mode?
Open to edit with local application.
Need to import in previously made files into repository.
See if it all syncs into remote github.

File retains edit-status switching out into other @android windows.
Autosaves at same time. Goodie.
[Shift+arrow] works. [Ctrl+Shift+arrow] does not. (Highlighting letter vs. words).
Needs to toggle from icon into Edit mode.
Going back into repository automatically saves changes.

Opened with @TURBO, wondering what sort of file this is by default with such odd syntax highlighting..
Swapped back into @sGit with changes saved. Nice.
~ @turbo: your stupid and annoying #bug with capitals/insert toggling is #workaround, wait a few seconds for caret to return to normal. Hmm.

Opened with @quoda
Nice "clouds" theme. Line indicator and everything. This is however still an undefined filetype.
Love @sGit for allowing one to open the file with a different program. (This looks like true love happening already..)
By the by has it been said already?
The merge happened! Woot!
[pretty much everything] was tried but as for the likely:
Merge, Push(a few billion-billion+2 times) and uh, Commit. Yeah.
 @quoda, that's insteresting stuff with brackets and quotes you have there.
 Brackets autoclose with highlights (bit too bright to see where one is typing or what, where) 
Quotes, single ones automagically get a pair. Would like to toggle one and dimmer the other. kthnxbai.
As mentioned before, the particular text editor is the bee's knees:
Comment out, bookmark lines.
"Force syntax" kinda does nothing?
No spellcheck. Still the 'knees.
Done. Pulled out the brackets. (Now they not highlighted all the time. At least until close?). Yeahhh.
Will #GTD_later check that stuff about code completion as well. For now, back..
[Ctrl+s] done here.

Back in @sGit, changes auto-reload.
