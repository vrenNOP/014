This things called @sGit.
Hey it works for editing.. Inside application.

[ctrl+s] does nothing. Thankfully.
Matches brackets when typing with color.
File made with no suffixing filetype. 
Will next: 
Add filetype to view syntax highlights in edit mode?
Open to edit with local application.
Need to import in previously made files into repository.
See if it all syncs into remote github.

File retains edit-status switching out into other @android windows.
Autosaves at same time. Goodie.
[Shift+arrow] works. [Ctrl+Shift+arrow] does not. (Highlighting letter vs. words).
Needs to toggle from icon into Edit mode.
Going back into repository automatically saves changes.

Opened with @TURBO, wondering what sort of file this is by default with such odd syntax highlighting..
Swapped back into @sGit with changes saved. Nice.
~ @turbo: your stupid and annoying #bug with capitals/insert toggling is #workaround, wait a few seconds for caret to return to normal. Hmm.
