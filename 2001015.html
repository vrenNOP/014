The java/android learning application @android.<OL>
<li> #gtd: Boil water. ll: (before going back in).

<li> "Hello World"--> "Hi world"? Really? 
<li> Giving it more credit, the basic of that was simply to say that, that was the command for simple printing and it could be changed, yadda yadda. [ctrl+e] for execute.
<li> ed: Even if there's no hotkey for skipping to next exercise easily... 

<li> #Remember!: [ctrl+s] save for the #no-autosave @droidedit.
<li> Uhm.  
<li> First code given with the tiniest of changes. Now code is given and not explained, line/section by part? Dude.
<li> Wow #p2p for this bull. Okay, maybe not as much as we diss it in a what for, still. That was not helpful and learnt nothing. Unless you count comments and every line needing semi-colon. Almost every line. Everything else? "void"? "class"? "sys.blah"? No help at all. #un.
