  New Character? Hah, nope, t's another way to push, pull and checkkk
  New term in #git dictionary:
  checkout = revert changes; TY(hold menu of files)
  No such thing as renaming file to one with suffix though it is easy to "force syntax" hghlights through a menu in edit/view mode.
  
  Pushed once.
  Gonna keep refreshing @chrome #online.
  Forced settings didn't stay in place, grr.
  Though as always different forces show interesting colors.
  
  So it's not push. At least not just.
  [add all to stage]+[push].
  Interesting that @sgit's editor auto increments the next line..
  	Kinda cool really
    So much that can be done with a nested visual hierachy. (not Heiragraphy haha)
    [fn+arrow] to make [end] does not work.Ah well. Can certainly push to @jota, hee.
  ll: Hmm. Looks like it's reallly not the above. Well that's okay too, yeah.

Pushed to @TURbo again. Love this layout. Program doesn't like to see a person continue happy though. This caps thing will take more than a bit of getting used to..
  Next is to try [commit]. This is the one that has made the most sense as of yet. "Log changes" was our own understanding.
  Nope. [commit]+[push].
  
  That's the one darlings. !!!!
