Notes <OL>
<li> ed: Thinking of using a palette from the get go.
<li> Added a [br] to pad out Notes text from canvas. ll: Two.//
		<pre>ll: ll: Other miscellaneous but non-linear additions go here?:
		Added border to canvas.//
		ll: Added 20% margin to document.//
		</pre>
<li> Nope, that #CSS [::first-line] pseudo-elementthingy definitely isn't flying in @droidEdit @android.
<li> ed: Them #JS objects weren't turning up.//
		<pre> After activating [preview in browser](@android #default because @chrome doesn't view incognito tabs and none in same window/view..
		Thought it might'v been the whole [type="text/JS"] thing but nope, truncated and same result.
		Realised again the [o.width] only definition for x..//~
		ll: [Math.PI] was written with a capital "a" typo. Amended. Checking..//
		</pre>
<li> That's everything in place. Now for alignments.
		<pre>ll: First questions first: Which sort of layout or information is being plotted?
		The persons? (OOh presents?) The factions? ll: Persons or characters are perhaps more focused to story but all know this for us, has been done to death. Factions today, it is then.
		<UL><li>Factions:
		<li>Colors: [Blue], [Grey], [Yellow], [White]
			<pre>Hierachy remains the same across factions; from bottom to top:
			Commoner/Member: (see below)
			Army: of following "groups" of officers; May also be of "commoner" status.
			Officers: Colors([R], [G], [B]) or. Stripes([Minuses], [Ones], [Crosses]).
			Leads/Heads: 
			
			</pre>
		<li>Suits: [Spade], [Club], [Heart]
		<li>and. [Diamond] king family/ies at top.
		<li>~ ll: Thinking if should make this into a table..
				<pre> Certainly would look more manageable?

<li> Need to look up how [th] is. Replacement for [tr] or [td]? ll: Or will try out for self first..
		<pre> Add visbiity to [table]. 
		ll: Forgot #CSS would only annotate it like a block element...
		ll: Is it really simple [table border]?
		TY(w3Schools). It's a binary value where [border=""] is the #HTML attribute. "1" means yeah.
		; Additionally, recall that to apply border (ll:ed: in only) #CSS because each of [TH],[TD], [TR], etc are also elements..
		ll: Looks like [th] is replacement for [tr].. ll: Or not. Definitely [td].//~
		</pre>
<li> ll: ed: Here's a mind to split document into related file-types. Again.
<li> Realised ed: why one [th] was centered while the other was not. ed: [th] is a replacement for [td]. so therefore if [tr] was replaced instead, there would simply be another cell there.//~

<li> [tr] not displaying border settings of #CSS.
		<pre> Rows, columns, row groups, and column groups cannot have borders TY(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18679020/border-around-tr-element-doesnt-show)
		ll: Sigh. Oh well, at least ed: adding closing tags to every damn line isn't as tedious as it sounded. Right at the beginning with the next opening is a good readibility standard.
		TY(same source): In the collapsing border model, it is possible to specify borders that surround all or part of a cell, row, row group, column, and column group.
		So we know, you gotta do tit to get tat. 'Cept not why.
		ll: TY(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20872200/giving-a-border-to-an-html-table-row-tr) page indicates it is the [table] element for which to set [table-collapse:collapse] for. (Why can't they just say true/false? Especially given the other options are "separate" and "inherit"...)
		ed: Same page mentions an [outline:solid 1px] property. @jsFiddle linked didn't work so will try that out next. ll: Last heard was that [outline] vs. [border] if recall right).

		ll: Okay used collapse. It looks Nice. Definitely need to take the table out of [pre] though.
		ll: Adding in [td] to showing borders for temporarily.
		ll: Correcting [colspan] to "4" not 2 for [faction: groups].
		ll: TY(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20375288/make-columns-of-equal-width-in-table):  If you set the style table-layout: fixed; on your table, you can override the browser's automatic column resizing. The browser will then set column widths based on the width of cells in the first row of the table. Change your to and remove the inside of it, and then set fixed widths for the cells in .
		Hmm. Same page mentions [width] in percentages. We know what that does already to elements within documents. TY: table-layout: fixed; /* optional, for equal spacing */
		~TY(http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?108964-Replace-TABLE-to-DIV) for example and (w3schools) for the quick testing platform. For [li] to act like table [td], one needs to apply a [float:left] attribute. ll: (Because elesewhere, someone mentioned [ul] was a completely dynamic alternative to [table]. With right #CSS).
		ll: Yeah, nope. [table-layout:fixed] did not work.
		ll: ed: Gave [width:20%] to new rule for only [td]. Unfortunately inclued [th]. using the [:not()] rule did not work to make an exclusion. ll: And of course there's stupid @droidEdit with that ":" bug.
		ll: ~ ll: Pushed what's so far to @gitHub. ll: Interesting thing, seems @sgit is not displaying files by modiefied last first. #bah.
		Removing fixed layout didn't do anything. It's the [width] alright.
		ed: Forgot about [pre]'s wrap problem. Setting.. Set to [pre-line] actually. ll: Indents are for editor-view not preview. ed: Little probs with silly little "] vs. }" typo.//	
		</pre>
<li> ll: Had enough with that huge [pre]? Back to prettier places.
<li> late revelation that; set a colspan to those primped [th]s yes?//
		<pre> ll: There. resolved. 
		Geez.
		Would like #plux a more flexible colspan number. uto adjustable when total number of [td] change.
		ll: The colspan="0" attribute in a TD is NOT spanning across all TDs in any of the above browsers.
Maybe not recommended as proper markup practice, but if you give a higher colspan value than the total possible no. of columns in other rows, then the TD would span all the columns.
This does NOT work when the table-layout CSS property is set to fixed. TY(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/398734/colspan-all-columns)
 ; Warning: as mentioned in the comments below this is actually the same as colspan="100". Hence, this solution will break for tables with over 100 columns. It is a hack and does NOT ensure your row spans all columns. Just use this: colspan="100%" 
		Coolios..//
		[th] setting of 0 did not work. #bah.//~
		Neither did the % appended version of it. ll: One just has to do things the hard way then//~
		; ed: grest thing with the [.length]in #JS though. Will use that if ever one gets that advanced.
		
		</pre>
<li>~Should remember from now on, little hanges like "ooh add a border" and asome shit is just boring to record. This "debuggery" not "log". Note mistakes, forgotten tricks, typos and hum, bugs. Not damn word everything one does. ll: Because all this white isn't blinding enough?//
<li>ll: Inserted a [style] section right before table. Works.//
<li>Wanted to use pure #CSS to define [colspan] by class for several cells at once.
		<pre>No such luck.
		There is no colspan in css as far as I know, but there will be column-span for multi column layout in the near future, but since it is only a draft in CSS3, you can check it in here. Anyway you can do a workaround using div and span with table-like display like this. TY(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2403990/html-colspan-in-css)

<li> Shuld've said night ages ago. Oh well.
<li> Now that ed: [diamond] is doing goodness knows what in terms of size and table is has been otherwise fixed, time for bed.
		<pre>ll: Oh of course. [td] is currently set to fixed width. Thi came to light when other [td] were modified and resulted in same appearance.//
		Yep. But now entire table is short and fat. There's fix for that.//
		ll: Took a bit of fiddling but: Added [width:100%] to only [table] selector. Removed [tble-layout:fixed] from [table,tr,td]. Fin!
		Or not. Good night you #bug-ger.
		</pre>
<li> ed: New fact; It's infintiely easier (less lag) to type both quotations then navigate back to type within them. @droidEdit.//
